# New to C3?

Although not inherently overwhelming, if you are thinking of using C3 as your first language, this guide will help you just good for a seamless transition to write your first ever code in C3 on arch based distros. <br> <br>
Use (these) command(s):
```
yay -S c3c-git
```
or,
```
paru -S c3c-git
```
or, 
```
aura -A c3c-git
```
Or as per required by your AUR package manager.

# Running your first C3 codefile!
Run the following commands:

```
mkdir C3 && cd C3
nvim src.c3
```

Feel free to replace the `src` with your own relevant required filename as well, although do keep the extension the same as `.c3` as it is not liable for changes.\
