# New to C3?

Although not inherently overwhelming, if you are thinking of using C3 as your first language, this guide will help you just good for a seamless transition to write your first ever code in C3 on arch based distros. <br> <br>
Use (these) command(s):
```
yay -S c3c-git
```
or
```
paru -S c3c-git
```
or
```
aura -A c3c-git
```
Decide as per your AUR package manager, or you want to be a bit more advanced do
```
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/c3c-git.git
cd c3c-git
makepkg -si
```
