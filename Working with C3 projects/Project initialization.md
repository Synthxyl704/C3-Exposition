## C3 Projects
The developers of the **C3 language** are generous to programmers in the way that they allows them to automate writing boilerplate code 
and structure with a simple singular command. <br> 
<hr>
However, it is NOT mandatory for using this awesome feature, you can initialize or create structures on your own volition as per requirement. <br>
Follwing this `.md`, you will <br>
- very easily be able to make your own C3 boilerplate structure with just a few keybord strokes      <br>
- understand the boilerplate structure and its working - like how everything connects and works      <br>
- understand `build` files, how to execute from build directory and other fun low-level information I researched! <br>
