## C3 Projects
The developers of the **C3 language** are generous to programmers in the way that they allows them to automate writing boilerplate code 
and structure with a simple singular command. <br>

> [!NOTE]
> It is NOT mandatory for using this awesome feature, you can initialize or create structures on your own volition as per requirement. <br>
> Practically however it is encouraged (at least by me, if youre a beginner) that you do test this out at the very least. <br>
> Pros of this feature include that there are commands which automate your compilation, and modularized structure stores executables in a seperate `build` directory, etc. <br>
> More of such will be explained further in this `.md`, keep reading. <br>

Follwing this `.md`, you will <br>
- very easily be able to make your own C3 boilerplate structure with just a few keybord strokes      <br>
- understand the boilerplate structure and its working - like how everything connects and works      <br>
- understand `build` files, how to execute from build directory and other fun low-level information I researched! <br>
